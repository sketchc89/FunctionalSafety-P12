# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System

The purpose of this project is to create functional safety documents for a proposed lane assistance system.

## Files

* [Safety Plan](./Documents/01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.docx) - The purpose of a safety plan is to outline the steps we will take in order to achieve functional safety. The safety plan will define the parts of the safety lifecycle impacted by new development, the roles and responsiblities of team members, the steps the company takes to promote safety culture, and the confirmation measures that will be used to determine that the plan makes the vehicle safer.

* [Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment](./Documents/02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.xlsx) - The purpose of hazard analysis and risk assessment is to list out scenarios and identify hazards for the purposes of determining their risk level in the system. Once the risk is known, an ASIL level can be determined that drive further requirements.

* [Functional Safety Concept](./Documents/03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.docx) - The purpose of the functional safety concept is to avoid accidents by reducing risk to acceptable levels.

* [Technical Safety Concept](./Documents/04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.docx) - The purpose of a technical safety concept is to tie functional safety concepts to components of a system such as the sensors, control units, and actuators.

* [Software Requirements and Architecture](./Documents/05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.docx) - The purpose of software requirements and architecture is to tie software requirements for software components to technical safety requirements.
